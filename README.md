# Producer-Consumer-Problem-
I created a simple program for producer consumer problem using MultyThreading in java programming language
Certainly! Let's create a simple **README file** for solving the **producer-consumer problem** using **Java** and the concept of **multiple threading**. The producer-consumer problem is a classic synchronization challenge where multiple processes share a common memory buffer. In this case, we'll use threads to implement the solution.

## Producer-Consumer Problem

The producer-consumer problem involves three entities:
1. **Producer**: Produces items and pushes them into a shared memory buffer.
2. **Consumer**: Consumes items by popping them out of the buffer.
3. **Memory Buffer**: Shared by both producer and consumer.

Here are the key rules:
- If the buffer is empty, the consumer waits for the producer to push an item.
- If the buffer is full, the producer waits for the consumer to consume an item before pushing a new one.
- The producer and consumer cannot access the buffer simultaneously.

### Solution using Threads

1. **Requirements**:
   - Producer and consumer tasks run in separate threads.
   - Common data bus (typically a message queue) used by both producer and consumer.

2. **Approach**:
   - If the buffer is not full, the producer pushes data into the queue or waits for it to be consumed.
   - If the buffer is not empty, the consumer takes data out of the queue or waits for the producer to publish.

3. **Issues with Synchronization**:
   - Without proper synchronization, we might encounter race conditions where the producer and consumer interfere with each other.
   - We need to ensure mutual exclusion when accessing the shared buffer.

4. **Introducing Synchronization**:
   - We can use Java's `synchronized` keyword or other synchronization mechanisms to protect critical sections of code.
   - Implement a separate class for the message queue with synchronized methods.

6. **Java Concurrency's `BlockingQueue`**:
   - For a more elegant solution, consider using `BlockingQueue` from `java.util.concurrent`.
   - It handles synchronization internally and simplifies producer-consumer interactions.

Remember that this is a simplified example. In real-world scenarios, you might need additional error handling and more complex logic. Happy coding! üöÄ
